# Countdown-Timer
My first HTML CSS and JavaScript project
The Countdown Timer Project is a beginner-friendly web development task that introduces core HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts. 
The goal is to create a dynamic countdown timer that displays the remaining time until a specific event or date, updating in real time.
Key Components:
1.	HTML: The basic structure of the timer is built using a <div> element to display the countdown.
2.	CSS: Styling is applied to enhance the visual appearance of the timer, such as customizing the font size, colors, and alignment to make it visually appealing.
3.	JavaScript: This is where the core logic happens. JavaScript calculates the time remaining by comparing the current time with the target event's time. The timer updates every second, displaying days, hours, minutes, and seconds. When the countdown reaches zero.
Project Purpose:
•	Learning Goal: This project helps beginners understand how to combine HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a practical way. It illustrates how JavaScript can manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) to create dynamic and interactive web elements.
•	Functionality: The countdown timer is a useful tool for events, reminders, or promotions, adding an interactive feature to websites.
This project provides a hands-on experience with basic web development concepts while building a functional and visually appealing countdown timer.
